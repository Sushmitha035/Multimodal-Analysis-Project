Content: 2024 was officially the hottest year on record, topping an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures, with the past ten years, 2015-2024, the ten warmest years on record. “Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,” the UN Secretary-General said. “There's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe,” he said. “But leaders must act – now.”  Updated national climate action plans, due this year, must include drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to limit long-term global temperature rise. Learn more about why every fraction of a degree of warming matters. We all have a role to play and a responsibility to speak up and act now for our common future. Download the app and use your actions – and your voice – to do your part. Thousands have shared their visions for the future by answering three questions on this website. You can too. Join the campaign and explore some of the visions here. Brazil, UNESCO and the UN have joined forces to strengthen research and measures to address disinformation campaigns that are delaying and derailing climate action. Human-induced global warming is causing sea levels to rise at unprecedented rates. Read the latest science on present-day impacts and future projections of sea-level rise.   Professor Celeste Saulo has always been fascinated by the weather. Now Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), she is seeing climate breakdown warp global weather systems beyond recognition, with devastating impacts on countless lives and livelihoods. In this episode of Awake at Night, Professor Saulo reflects on our shared responsibility to future generations, on an emotional meeting with Pope Francis, and on why she can never give up hope. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is supporting the African diaspora in establishing an investment company driving growth in climate-smart agriculture in Africa. The initiative demonstrates that capital investments can combine profitability with sustainable development, offering a blueprint for Africa’s future growth and resilience to climate change here. Sudanese activist, peacebuilder and former member of the UN Secretary General's Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change, Nisreen Elsaim understands the nexus between conflict and extreme weather events firsthand. She offers four solutions for ensuring the best approach to addressing these interconnected challenges. What do food, health, water or energy have to do with climate change?

Glaciers are crucial for regulating the global climate and providing freshwater, essential for billions of people. However, due to climate change, these vital resources are rapidly melting. The International Year focuses on providing concrete recommendations to address climate change impacts, advocating and raising funds for more ambitious action, and convening countries and communities affected by glacier loss.

To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by almost half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. To achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable.

At the same time, the loss of wetlands could worsen the impact of climate change, as these ecosystems provide essential services that mitigate the effects of climate change.

  This week in data: New analysis by Carbon Brief reveals that nearly a tenth of global climate finance could be under threat, as Trump continues to cut spending on international aid. 

Since taking office in January, Trump has pulled the US out of multiple international climate funds and initiatives, including plans withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement. 

He has also threatened to cancel virtually all US Agency for International Development (USAid) projects, with climate funds identified as a prime target. These actions are likely to endanger global efforts to help developing countries tackle climate change.
