Title: Sound On Sound | The World's Premier Music Recording Technology Magazine
Content: The S.B.G-PRO is capable of operating in mono or stereo, supports balanced and unbalanced equipment, and also allows for CV-based control of external devices. Sonicware's LIVEN Ambient Ø has just received a free firmware update that introduces support for seven new microtonal tuning systems. The Echolocator has been created in collaboration with 112db.com, and offers a range of delay effects that benefit from in-depth hands-on control. Valve System VA645 has been designed to react to incoming in the same way as analogue hardware, and is said to deliver a range of tonal characters while avoiding harsh-sounding distortions.  Said to be the twisted counterpart of Tracktion's LOVE plug-in, Dawesome HATE is capable of generating everything from subtle warmth to “total sonic destruction”. M-Leveller analyses the incoming signal and applies gain changes to individual notes and phrases, and promises to ensure consistent levels with unmatched transparency. The latest addition to IK Multimedia’s TONEX family provides users of the hardware pedals with the ability to organise and make real-time edits to their Tone Models and presets. The third release from SRM Sounds captures a 15-piece timpani ensemble performing at Studio Richter Mahr, and includes some additional synth-based content courtesy of an original Minimoog.  Cubase 14.0.20 introduces some changes to the Pattern and Score Editors, additional Audio Export options and a new Audio Segment Detection feature capable of highlighting individual elements such as words, drum hits in audio regions.  Oeksound’s long‑awaited third plug‑in is a quietly radical alternative to equalisation. Malcolm Toft gives a fascinating insight into his career, from building his first mixing desk at age 17, being part of the team at the launch of the iconic Trident Studios, where he recorded Elton John, Queen and David Bowie, to founding Trident Audio Developments to manufacture his consoles. To mark the company’s 100th anniversary, Shure have teamed up with Black Lion Audio and Korneff Audio to reissue the infamous ‘secret weapon’ that powers many of Tchad Blake’s greatest recordings. In this episode, Eddie Bazil looks at ways of enhancing a variety of individual tracks and full mixes using plug-ins that are designed to achieve the retro warmth and cohesion of tapes and valves. Composer and Sound Designer Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe (aka Lichens) talks to Caro C about his preferred sound modules and working methodologies. I was just watching an online tutorial by iZotope, and they discussed NS‑10s and Auratone cubes being used to focus on the midrange. Is this a sound I can achieve with EQ? Space Rider offers delay, reverb and chorus, but also takes the concept of ducking and expands it to full parameter modulation. Sign Up TO
